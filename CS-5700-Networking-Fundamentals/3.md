# Module 3: Implementing Network Software, Performance, Perspectives on Connecting (Textbook 1.4, 1.5, 2.1)

Note: These notes are not based on class "lectures". I simply cannot follow the official instructor.
However, the author of the textbook has lectures freely available on YouTube. Given that the course
uses the official slides that were prepared by the textbook author, I am confident the lecturte
covers the same information.

- Slides: [Ch 1](/CS-5700-Networking-Fundamentals/Lectures/ch1-v8.2.pdf), [Ch 2]()
