# CS 5700 Networking Fundamentals

**Fall 2024 Semester**
Studies network protocols, focusing on modeling and analysis, and architectures. Topics include
network architecture, software, and performance. Discusses encoding and framing. Presents the
different harmonizing functions needed for communication and efficient operation of computer
networks and discusses examples of Ethernet and wireless networks. Covers link layer protocols
including HDLC and PPP; packet framing; spanning tree, error detection techniques, and automatic
repeat request algorithms.
