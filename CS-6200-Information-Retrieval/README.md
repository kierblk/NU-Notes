# CS 6200 Information Retrieval

Fall 2024 Semester

## Course Texts
There is no single required text for the course; however, we will refer to three different texts, and we strongly suggest following the readings from one or both of the following:

- **CMS**: Search Engines: Information Retrieval in PracticeLinks to an external site.. Croft, Metzler and Strohman (Addison-Wesley).
- **MRS**: Introduction to Information RetrievalLinks to an external site.. Manning, Raghavan, and Sch√ºtze (Cambridge).
- **CIS**: Conversational Information SeekingLinks to an external site.. Zamani, Trippas, Dalton, and Radlinski (2023 arXiv draft).
